**<h1> Fitbit App: FEEL </h1>**

The app is developed for a Fitbit smartwatch, which measures the user's heartbeat. Because there is a correlation between different emotions and the heartbeat, we wanted to detect a drastic change in the heartbeat, specifically when the heartbeat is above 100 bpm, and ask the user via a message on the smartwatch's screen whether he/she feels ok. A slight vibration is also activated with the message, so the user can notice something is happening. The idea is that the person is consciously aware of a detected change. It is up to him/her to decide whether the change is caused by a specific situation that causes particular emotions. If yes, via the message on the screen and the vibration, he is motivated to open the questionnaire and to record how he/she feels, how intense the emotions are, and the reason behind it. Additionally, on the screen is also shown how many times the smartwatch triggered the user that day so that he/she can have an overall look and compare the number with the number of recorded emotions in the questionnaire he/she made at the end of the day.
